1. Porject Overview
Objective

This project aims to develop and evaluate deep learning models for post-flood scene understanding using the FloodNet dataset. The dataset, introduced in the IEEE paper FloodNet: A High Resolution Aerial Imagery Dataset for Post Flood Scene Understanding, provides high-resolution aerial imagery with pixel-level annotations for semantic segmentation tasks.

Content: High-resolution aerial images captured post-flood
Project Goals

Accurately classify flood-affected regions
Benchmark performance using standard metrics

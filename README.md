# 1. Porject Overview

**Objective**

This project aims to develop and evaluate deep learning models for post-flood scene understanding using the FloodNet dataset. The dataset, introduced in the IEEE paper FloodNet: A High Resolution Aerial Imagery Dataset for Post Flood Scene Understanding, provides high-resolution aerial imagery with pixel-level annotations for semantic segmentation tasks.

**Dataset Summary**

- Name: [FloodNet](https://github.com/BinaLab/FloodNet-Supervised_v1.0)  
- Source: IEEE publication  
- Content: High-resolution aerial images captured post-flood  

**Project Goals**

- Accurately classify flood-affected regions  
- Benchmark performance using standard metrics

**Real-World Impact**

- Supports automated flood damage assessment  
- Aids emergency response and infrastructure planning  
- Contributes to climate resilience and disaster mitigation
